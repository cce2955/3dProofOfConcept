# 3dProofOfConcept
3D game proof of concept with javascript

Fun little game I'm going to make (probably won't be fun making it).

<h1> 3D </h1>
3D will be handled by the THREE.js framework, all logic pertaining to movement and camera, etc. will be handled by me

<h1>Logic</h1>
The game will be a mix of real time and turn based. If the player has the ball they can move anywhere in 3D movement, upon encountering an opponent they can pass, shoot, or attempt to go through the enemies. Likewise if they don't have the ball they can try to take it from an enemy or block them

<h1> Sound</h1>
TBD, edited and mixed in Audacity/sound forge most likely
<h1> Texture/Art</h1>
TBD, more then likely edited via GIMP

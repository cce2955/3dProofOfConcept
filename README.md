3D game proof of concept with <b> javascript</b>

  

Fun little game I'm going to make (probably won't be fun making it).

  

<h1>Concepts Utilized:</h1>

<ul>

<li><s>Getters and Setters</s> So javascript is weird, I have my getters and setters set up but I got confused at implementation. This entire project will be getting a nice refactoring in the future where I'll properly utilize them.

<li>Bubble sort.

<li> Iterating via lambda function.

<li>implementation of a third part library.

<li>class creation.

<li> Accessing and storing multiple class objects in an array.

<li> 3D Collision and camera rotation

<li> Enumeration

<li> Column limit on average of 80 characters
<li> Array Manipulation

</ul>

  <h1> Curent Progress</h1>
  <ul>  <li> Ball Spawns
<li> Players spawn with their indiviual stats, coordinates, team assignments and possession
<li>Basic skybox done
<li>Basic Goals and Ball landing area done
<li>collison for ball/player is finished
<li> HUD is initialized, populating information
<li> Basic camera control (pivot point needs to be altered)
<li> Rudimentary game states are being conceptualized in code
<li> Scene, camera, and renderer works

  

<h1> 3D </h1>

3D will be handled by the <b>THREE.js</b> framework, all logic pertaining to movement and camera, etc. will be handled by me

  

<h1> HUD</h1>

Hud is handled thanks to the <b>dat.GUI</b> framework

  

<h1>Logic</h1>

The game will be a mix of real time and turn based. If the player has the ball they can move anywhere in 3D movement, upon encountering an opponent they can pass, shoot, or attempt to go through the enemies. Likewise if they don't have the ball they can try to take it from an enemy or block them

  

<h1> Sound</h1>

TBD, edited and mixed in <b>Audacity/sound forge</b> most likely

<h1> Texture/Art</h1>

TBD, more then likely edited via <b>GIMP</b> OR <B> photoshop</b>

  

Short Term TO-DO (3/5/2020)

<ul>

<li> update camera pivot points</li>

<li> figure out how to populate the GUI for player attributes</li>

<li>clean up unused imports</li></ul>
